This folder contains files to automatically produce test scripts for .vm files
It is intended to compare your translator against the built in translator

Step 1)
first of all you need to have your translator and the tester in your ~/.bashrc file. For me:
export PATH=${PATH}:~/csadelaide-nand2tetris/tools
export PATH=${PATH}:~/csadelaide-nand2tetris/projects/prac6/VMTranslator
export PATH=${PATH}:~/csadelaide-nand2tetris/projects/prac6/Tester
then run $source ~/.basrc to load it all in

Step 2)
cd to the tester directory and compile the tester on your machine using $make all

Step 3)
create a NAME.test file where NAME is the same as your .vm file, i.e AddSub.vm will test with AddSub.test

each line in the .test file will create a new AddSubXX series of files

the format is:
segment offset x; segment offset y

or

segment offset x:y; segment offset s:t for a randomly generated range of variables

each string separated by a ; will preload the given memory address with the value in the .tst files.

Step 4)
with a file.vm and a file.test in a directory of your choosing, run $Test.sh

It will translate your .vm to .asm, generate all the .tst, .cmp and .out files, and tell you if End of script - Comparison ended successfully
